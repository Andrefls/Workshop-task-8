# This all about persistence

## Synopsis

Oh Lord, how can I describe this silly idea? After attending our lecture, I realized that I might be able to colour my painting using random information from an API website. The idea was to fill a shape with that information. I thought, after seeing the example, that I could do it very easily. What could possibly go wrong? I was just following a sample and retrieving some information from the internet. Yeahh right. 

## Summary/Problem-solving

- I started the task by using the provided example.
-
- After watching the class video from
-
- https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967,
-
- I decided to begin my project by reviewing the majority of the API mentioned in the lecture.
-
- Eventually, I found something that could be suitable for my exercise on
-
- https://php-noise.com/.
-
- Following the example from our lecture, I began my work.
-
- I searched the internet for information to help me retrieve data from that page.
-
- After trying numerous methods to gather information during the lecture, I became frustrated.
-
- I looked for samples online, but I couldn't find much helpful information.
-
- It was the weekend, and I didn't want to bother the lecturer, so after not finding many examples, I went to Meta and asked for help on how to retrieve information from the website.
-
- Meta provided me with a lot of code snippets, but unfortunately, none of them worked.
-
- Initially, I thought I had found a solution for my coding problems, but it turned out not to be the case.
However, I did learn a few valuable things:

- 1. P5.js has a function to create image noise.

- 2. The Math object in JavaScript can help with operations, such as rounding numbers, which is useful for RGB values that need to be between 1 and 255.

- 3. Meta had misled me; their examples were not retrieving information from the API but instead selecting random RGB values and painting them on my shape.

- After that, I considered my next steps. I applied some of the lessons from Meta in my coding, such as using the Math object for my RGB colours.
-
- I also realized that if I didn't just ask for information from the API but instead requested the names of the colours, I could choose a random colour and then send it to the API. This would allow me to request data to change randomly in return. At this point, I was feeling a bit overwhelmed.
-
- I modified my code to the point where it started working, but I was still frustrated and needed help from our lecturer to fix a few issues.
-
- He looked at my API and mentioned that it was producing an image, so there was no easy way to retrieve that information with the knowledge we currently possessed.
-
- He provided me with an example of how to retrieve image information. At this point, I was too tired and decided to stop for the day.
-
- The next day, I chose to explore a new website and see if I could make it work.
-
- I found
-
- https://www.thecolorapi.com/. This page didn't allow me to retrieve RGB values, but it did provide the names and HEX codes of colors, which I considered a plus.
-
- I adapted my coding to work with that data.
-
- However, I struggled with my code running slowly. Finally, after trying examples from my previous work, I managed to set up the intervals correctly.
-
- After I sent our lecturer the example, he helped me tidy up the code to make it shorter and more consistent.

## Future development

- I want to learn more about retrieving random information from APIs, specifically related to emotions.


## Conclusion

- I have an idea that produce a lot of frustration, but, at the end, I did something that gave me a lot of knowledge and that was the antidote to cure my frustrating stage.
